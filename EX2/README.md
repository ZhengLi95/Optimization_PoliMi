# EXERCISE 2 #

Suppose the foods listed below have calories, protein, calcium, vitamin A, and costs per
pound as shown. In what amounts should these food be purchased to meet at least the daily
requirements listed while minimizing the total cost? (This problem comes from George B.
Dantzigâ€™s classic book, Linear Programming and Extensions, page 118. We will take his word on
nutritional values, and for nostalgic reasons have left the prices as they were when the book was
published in 1963.)
