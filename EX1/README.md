You are in charge of an advertising campaign for a new product, with a budget of $1 million.
You can advertise on TV or in magazines. One minute of TV time costs $20,000 and reaches 1.8 million potential customers; 
a magazine page costs $10,000 and reaches 1 million. You must sign up for at least 10 minutes of TV time.
How should you spend your budget to maximize your audience? Formulate the problem in AMPL and solve it.
